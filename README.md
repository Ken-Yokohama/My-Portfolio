### Brief Summary
My-Portfolio is a static landing page used to showcase all of my projects, technologies, experiences and achievements throughout my career as a developer. This project was built using React and uses Framer-Motion to handle all CSS animation. Additionally My-Portfolio uses several 3rd party API's to track and display the amount of times each user visited the site as well as handle email requests from the contact me page.
